# TreecapitatorSpigot
 A Spigot plugin allowing players to fell trees in one go with an axe, based off the Forge mod.

## Usage
When a player with the `treecapitator.fell` permission breaks a log with an axe, the plugin will also break all other logs upwards and outwards.
Any logs directly below the original log broken will remain.
If a player sneaks while breaking a log, the log will be broken as normal if the `sneak-ignore` configuration option is enabled (enabled by default).
